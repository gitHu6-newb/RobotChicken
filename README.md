Digital method for me personally playing the Automa base(ish) game.

## 1. Load the -=SETUP=- deck, dealing 6 cards to your hand. 
 - (known issue- on desktop browser version, it's not segragating the 4 cards correctly to leave on the playmat, so the next step is to go hunting for the right cards)
 - Flip the 4 cards to place them over their outlines (or wherever you want).

## 2. Load 1 of the Bonus Card decks, and Don't deal to your hand (click the 'X').
  - Automa-only has just the 4 special cards for Automa
  - The other bonus deck has nearly all bonus cards, minus some personally disliked cards:
    - Base Game: Cartographer, Historian
    - Oceania: the consecutive wingspan types, Site Selection Expert
    - Asia: I kept only The Winter Feeder

## 3. Load the Round 1 deck, and Don't deal to your hand (click the 'X').
  - (the other rounds have the appropriate card(s) already removed but it's just as easy to do it manually, too)
  - The RAOUtoma card is also available, but must be manually loaded via the Cards option if you want it. Look for the "Rank" of RAOUtoma

## 4. Add some "Tokens" to keep track of Automa's End of Round Score.
