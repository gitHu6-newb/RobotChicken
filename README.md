Digital method for me personally playing the Automa base game.

Load the -=SETUP=- deck, dealing 6 cards to your hand. 
 (known issue- on desktop browser version, it's not segragating the 4 cards correctly to leave on the playmat)
Flip the 4 cards to place them over their outlines (or wherever you want.

Load 1 of the Bonus Card decks. 
  -Automa-only has just the 4 special cards for Automa
  -The other bonus deck has nearly all bonus cards (minus some personally disliked cards:
                                                      Base Game: Cartographer, Historian
                                                      Oceania: the consecutive wingspan types, Site Selection Expert
                                                      Asia: I kept only The Winter Feeder)

Load the Round 1 deck. (the other rounds have the appropriate card(s) already removed but it's just as easy to do it manually, too)
  -The RAOUtoma card is also available, but must be manually loaded via the Cards option. Look for the "Rank" of RAOUtoma
